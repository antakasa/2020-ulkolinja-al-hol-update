00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We went there only because we wanted a normal Islamic life, -

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
where we can wear a hijab.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We really didn't know that the war was that bad.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
We wanted to leave but couldn't. We had to stay there.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We went there voluntarily.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
When we saw what was happening we wanted to leave but couldn't.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You knew you'd end up in trouble if you tried to leave.
